- Git integration? Maybe rely on git and ignore if not

## Todo Bug / Incomplete
- Vis commands doesnt update selection at fist (same for cmd finder)
- Use users real shell instead of sh
- Shell commands dont operate in the correct directory
- Directories do not refresh after commands change them (mul-copy)
- multi select edit should offer to do something
- when exploded there is really no need to check for mimetypes

- Multi-select across dirs
- Floating/extra windows
- Resume location

## VS Yazi
