# Sonar
## Todo Feat
- Git integration? Maybe rely on git and ignore if not
- Select alt, like right click for context (delete, multi, etc)?
- Better input handling (especially for commands)
- Scroll/progress bars
- Shortcuts / bookmarks
- Hide preview window
    - If preview window hidden dont generate preview or meta
- Show selection in cmd window
- Mouse support?
- Seer?

## Todo Bug / Incomplete
- multi select edit should offer to do something
- when exploded there is really no need to check for mimetypes
- Images need to draw inside preview
- Hashmap instead of Vec for cmds?
- Preview executables (at least file size etc)
- Sanitize shell output
